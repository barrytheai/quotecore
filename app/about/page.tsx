                  <p>For twelve years, he was on the tools. Multiple quotes a day, some days. Each one the same process: measure on site, bring the numbers home, work out the pricing, write it up, file it, send it. Then hope the client hadn't already gone with someone else.</p>
                  <p>He shared the workload with another man who had his own system. Which meant two systems. Which meant no system.</p>
                  <p>The paper files were a nightmare. Jobs stacked in folders. Old quotes mixed with new ones. Trying to find a previous job's measurements when a similar roof came up - ten minutes of searching through paper instead of ten seconds on a screen.</p>
                  <p className="font-medium text-zinc-800">He knew there had to be a better way. He just couldn't find it.</p>

                  <p>The tools available were either generic - built for "trades" and completely misunderstanding how a roofer actually prices a job - or so complex they needed a trained estimator to operate them.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was built for the working roofer. He wanted something that understood roofing. That knew the difference between a hip and a valley. That could take his measurements and turn them into a professional client-ready quote without him spending two hours reformatting a Word document.</p>
                  <p className="font-medium text-zinc-800">That software didn't exist. So he built it.</p>

                  <p>QuoteCore+ isn't built by developers who interviewed a few roofers. It's built by someone who lived the problem for over a decade. Every feature exists because someone who spent twelve years roofing decided it should.</p>
                  <p>Before launch, it was tested and refined by working roofers across the industry - contractors who quoted real jobs through the platform and gave honest feedback on what wasn't good enough. Every iteration shaped by people who actually use it on the job.</p>
                  <p className="font-medium text-zinc-800">The result is a quoting tool that thinks the way a roofer thinks - because it was built by one.</p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-zinc-600">QuoteCore+ started in roofing because that was the problem Shaun knew first-hand. But the same chaos - manual measuring, copied numbers, reformatted spreadsheets, quotes sent too late - exists across construction. Today QuoteCore+ is used by trades businesses of all kinds: roofing, cladding, flooring, fencing, landscaping, general building, exterior works, and more.</p>
