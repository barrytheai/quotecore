QuoteCore+ is the strongest choice for tradies who quote from plans and need a complete workflow from measurement to job completion. Tradify and Fergus are strong for team management and job tracking. ServiceM8 works well for high-volume service trades." } },

Tradify has a trial period. Most platforms require a paid subscription - the cost is typically recovered in the first month through time saved on admin and faster quote turnaround." } },
      { "@type": "Question", "name": "How much does quoting software cost for NZ tradespeople?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Most quoting platforms for NZ tradies range from approximately $39 to $79 per month for a sole trader or small team. Buildxact starts higher at around $149/month due to its more complex feature set." } },
      { "@type": "Question", "name": "What is the difference between quoting software and job management software?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Quoting software focuses on generating priced proposals quickly and professionally. Job management software focuses on what happens after a quote is accepted - scheduling, team coordination, job tracking, and invoicing. Most modern platforms attempt to do both." } },
      { "@type": "Question", "name": "Can I use quoting software on my phone on site?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Most platforms on this list have mobile apps that work on iOS and Android. For plan-based takeoffs, a tablet is more practical than a phone, though both work." } },
      { "@type": "Question", "name": "Is Tradify or Fergus better for NZ tradies?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Both are NZ-built and well-regarded. Tradify is stronger on job scheduling and team management. Fergus is stronger on job costing and profitability tracking. If knowing your actual job margins matters most, Fergus. If managing a team is the priority, Tradify." } },
      { "@type": "Question", "name": "How long does it take to send a quote using quoting software?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "For a straightforward job with saved pricing templates, most platforms can produce a quote in 10-20 minutes. For complex project work using plan-based takeoff in QuoteCore+, the first quote on a new project type might take 30-45 minutes to set up - after that, similar jobs are much faster." } }

QuoteCore+ is the strongest for contractors quoting from plans who need a full workflow from measurement to materials order.

The goal is to quote the same day as the site visit - ideally before leaving. The delay in most quoting processes is not measurement but the admin that comes after it." }
