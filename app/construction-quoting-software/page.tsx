                    QuoteCore+ is led by Shaun&apos;s real experience across construction, roofing, project management and operations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Shaun lived the problem: jobs spread across measurements, spreadsheets, quote documents, emails, material lists, follow-up notes and invoices.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The QuoteCore+ team built around that workflow to create a platform that is practical, flexible and designed to adapt to how trade businesses actually work.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The product started from roofing experience, but the problem is much wider than roofing. Any trade that needs to quote, order, manage, invoice and get paid can run into the same disconnected admin.
