  },
  {
    q: "How is QuoteCore+ different from generic quoting tools?",
    a: "Most generic quoting tools help you create a quote document. QuoteCore+ is built around the full workflow roofing contractors deal with: measuring, pricing, quoting, customer approval, ordering materials, managing the job, invoicing and getting paid.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can QuoteCore+ help with roofing measurements?",
    a: "Yes. QuoteCore+ supports digital takeoffs and measurement-based quoting, so roof sections, lengths, areas, flashings and other job details can feed directly into the quote workflow.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does QuoteCore+ handle materials ordering?",
    a: "Yes. Accepted quotes can be used to support materials ordering, so you do not need to rebuild the same job details manually after the customer approves the quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does QuoteCore+ include invoicing?",
    a: "Yes. QuoteCore+ is designed to keep the job connected through to invoicing and payment, so the workflow does not stop once the quote is accepted.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is QuoteCore+ only for roofers?",
    a: "No. QuoteCore+ started with roofing because that is where the original workflow problem came from, but it is built for trade and construction businesses that quote from measurements and need to manage the job through to invoice and payment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free trial?",
    a: "Yes. QuoteCore+ offers a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.",
